# AI for GME (Artificial Intelligence for Graduate Medical Education)

This web-based tool uses artificial intelligence to generate and store educational content, assessment questions, and clinical scenarios for Graduate Medical Education (GME) programs.

## Features

- Case Generation: AI-powered generation of clinical scenarios and case studies for resident education and assessment.
- Question Bank: AI-generated assessment questions and answers for GME programs, including multiple-choice questions, short-answer questions, and essay questions.
- Curriculum Development: AI-assisted development of GME curricula, including learning objectives, educational goals, and assessment strategies.
- Search Function: Searchable database of generated content for easy access and reuse.
- User Profile: User profiles to save and organize generated content for future use.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

## Usage

1. Navigate through the different sections using the menu at the top of the page.
2. Fill out the forms in each section to generate AI-powered content:
   - Case Generation: Enter a medical specialty and complexity level to generate a clinical case.
   - Question Bank: Specify a topic and question type to generate assessment questions.
   - Curriculum Development: Enter a program name and duration to generate a curriculum outline.
3. Use the Search function to find previously generated content.
4. View your user profile and saved content in the Profile section.

## Note

This is a frontend prototype that simulates AI-generated content. In a production environment, this would be connected to a backend server with actual AI models for content generation.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a backend server with AI models for real-time content generation.
- Add user authentication and database storage for saving generated content.
- Enhance the user interface with more interactive elements and real-time updates.
- Implement more advanced search functionality with filters and sorting options.
- Add the ability to export generated content in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
